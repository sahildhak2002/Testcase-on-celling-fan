# Testcase-on-celling-fan
This test case document outlines the manual testing of a standard electric fan (e.g., ceiling fan, table fan, or pedestal fan). The objective of this testing is to verify the functionality, usability, performance, and safety features of the fan under various operating conditions. The tests are conducted to ensure the fan operates as expected, including power functions, speed levels, oscillation, remote and regulator control, and safety mechanisms.

# Scope of Testing:
Basic functionality (ON/OFF)

Speed variations (Low, Medium, High)

Remote and wall regulator operations

Oscillation (for table/pedestal fan)

Performance at continuous usage

Safety and build quality checks

# Tools Used:
Manual operation

Visual inspection for physical damage

# Key Features Tested:
Power control using switch and remote

Speed control using regulator and remote

Oscillation mechanism

Noise levels at various speeds

Behavior after power cut

Overheating after long usage

Blade protection and child safety

Mount stability and vibration

# Testing Outcome:
Total Test Cases Executed: 15

Passed: 10

Failed: 5

Failed scenarios include remote response failure, reverse rotation not functioning, and minor noise or stability issues.
